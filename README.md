# JuneDataCollectionsPlayground

A little Swift playground to explore Protocols and Saving Data from Develop in Swift Data Collections (https://apple.co/developinswiftdatacollections) and a head start on the homework to build a To Do List app, either in UIKit or SwiftUI.

This is from the Dive into Data Collections class for AATCe members in June 2023.

## AnimatedSpace.swiftpm

This is a Swift Playgrounds app you can run on your iPad or Mac with Xcode or Playgrounds to play around with animating a few different views, along the theme of Space, for day two, in which we build SpacePhoto (source available here: (https://github.com/mhanlon/NASA-Photo-of-the-Day-App)).
